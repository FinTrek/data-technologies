# Preamble

***I am using Yihui's minimal example for right now. Thanks, Yihui!***

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown** from Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter. ***HH: note that the chapters are included in alphabetical order***
