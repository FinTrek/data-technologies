# US flights


HH: what I like to include here:

- discussion of airlines: number of passengers, centralized/de-centralization (hubs or not), fuel consumption
- discussion of delays: by time of day, day of week, airport, airline
- finding exceptions: delays of more than 24h, balloons at 600 mph, ...
- making a movie of the flights

I would also like to use new data rather than the Expo data.
